# Modulev2.0

In this project, we aim to make an educational web application that delivers content dynamically to students based on their domain knowledge level. 
The app is made in django with a postgres database. Functionality is added with vanilla javascript and jQuery handles asynchronus submission of form data
This project is a work in progress, beginning in the final months of 2021. As of Jan 2, 2022 I am working in the Force section of the app (Force_HLG and Force_LLG)
